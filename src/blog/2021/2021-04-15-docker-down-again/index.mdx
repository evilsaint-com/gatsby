Well, I learnt my lesson from the other day. Seeing as I use Docker quite a bit I was surprised, to say the least, that I couldn't even pull a few basic packages down until I remembered to check on my old friend <a href="https://status.docker.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External Link to docker.com" rel=”nofollow”>https://status.docker.com/</a>

I mean what was "Error response from daemon: received unexpected HTTP status: 503 Service Unavailable" supposed to mean when trying to run the hello-world example for confirmation of a successful Docker install.

Annoying yes! but knowing it is not something I have done makes me feel a little better.
