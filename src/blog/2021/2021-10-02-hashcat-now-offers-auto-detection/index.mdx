description: "The latest edition of Hashcat now has an auto-detect mode built-in. If you pass a hashes file to Hashcat with no additional options, it will try to detect the hash types. It is a new feature, and so you will need a recent copy of Hashcat to utilise this feature."

I just learnt this from a colleague at work and felt it was worth a share. Hashcat now has auto-detect functionality. Run your Hashcat binary and pass only the hash file, and Hashcat will try and work out the hash types included in the file and give you the mode you need to crack them. 

```
hashcat <hash file>
```

<figure class="figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12">

In the above example, I am using Hashcat version 6.2.4; however, I have been informed that the auto-detect feature was added in Hashcat 6.2.2. 

In the screen capture below, we can see the detected hash types in my file.

The orange text indicates that this is a best-effort detection; however, it is correct in my case. The file contains five NTLM hashes.
