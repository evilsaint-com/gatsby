Have you ever returned to your Nessus to realise you have forgotten your password or just forgotten the user name?

You are not alone, this happens to the best of us.

Nessus is the world’s most popular vulnerability assessment tool. It is an open-source vulnerability scanner although there is also a commercial option. option Open a terminal and type the command `cd /opt/nessus/sbin` to navigate to the `sbin` directory. Here type `ls`  to see the contents of this directory as shown below.

If you can't remember the user name then you can just run the following command `./nessuscli lsuser` to see all the Nessus users configured.

Here, we have only one. Let us reset the 'evilsaint' user! 

Type command ` ./nessuscli chpasswd evilsaint`. The system will prompt you to enter the new password. Enter the password two times as shown below. You have successfully reset your Nessus password. Now login with the new password.
