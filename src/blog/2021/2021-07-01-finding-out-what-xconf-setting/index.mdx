If you often find yourself configuring Xfce then this tip might be for!

Xfce or XFCE (pronounced as four individual letters) is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. Xfconf is the configuration storage system for Xfce and we have to interact with it using the `xfconf-query` tool. 

> To access the `xfconf` there is a CLI tool `xfconf-query`. 
> https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfconf/xfconf-query

If you sometimes find yourself forgetting a property or wanting to learn a new property then you can run  `xconf-query` in monitor mode like so:
```
xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -m
```
You can then change whatever setting you want on the system and observe for any xfce4-desktop changes to be displayed in the terminal. 

You can then do the following to change the property from your terminal or from inside your scripts later on by doing the following:
```
 xfconf-query -c xfce4-desktop -p <property> -s <set path/image/value>
```
