## Remote HP Smart App

## Install New Software

In my case I have a HP Envy 4520 that sits at the end of my desk. I can go here and grab the [HP Envy 4520 Drivers](https://support.hp.com/gb-en/drivers/selfservice/closure/hp-envy-4520-all-in-one-printer-series/5447920)

Yes. Go to Windows 10 "Apps and Features" and uninstall the HP SMART APP then reboot your PC. Then go to HP Support web page for HP OfficeJet XXXX (put in for your specific model) then go to "Software and Drivers" and scroll down to "Software-Utility" and download "HP OfficeJet XXXX series Print and Scan Driver and Accessories" (164 MB in my case) and install that. Be sure to disable the litany of privacy check boxes in the first screen or two before the install begins (see the links). Voila. No more account requirement to scan.
