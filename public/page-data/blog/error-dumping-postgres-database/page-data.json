Like most hackers and penetration testers, I spend most of my day working in various Virtual Machines (VMs). Over time you get to see lots of errors and quirky bugs, and you learn how to fix these issues. Quite often, a colleague will send me a screenshot over the internal comms, asking if I know how to fix a particular issue. To reduce support time and share the wealth with my readers, I have decided that each time I encounter one of these from now on, I will document the fix.  \n\n## The Error\n\n>VMware Workstation cannot connect to the virtual machine. Make sure you have the right to run the program, access all directories the program uses, and access all directories for temporary files. \n\n>The VMware Authorization Service is not running. \n\n## How to fix this?\n\n<h5 class=\"step\">Step 1)</h5> \n\nRight-click on the taskbar and select task manager. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/a0884e80-3f2f-4f17-9a2e-a2df961785f8.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Go to taskmanager.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">Go to taskmanager.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h5 class=\"step\">Step 2)</h5>\n\n Kill off any VMware Processes \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/4f8d486c-33e4-4692-971f-b65d512dad23.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Kill VMware Processes.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">Kill VMware Processes.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h5 class=\"step\">Step 3)</h5>\n\nPress `Win` + `R` and type in `services.msc`\n\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/69ee42d4-29b7-410c-8537-532364f6f64d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Open Up Services.msc.\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">Open Up Services.msc.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h5 class=\"step\">Step 4)</h5>\n\nStart the \"VMware Authorization Service\"\n\nAll done!
