A simple birthday attack can be used to identify 64-bit block cipher collisions when using the CBC mode of operation. When a collision occurs, it means that the input and output are the same, allowing the encrypted data to be exfiltrated.\n- The use of a 64-bit block ciphers is likely to produce a collision after 32 GB of data, but for a practical attack the researchers found that up to 785 GB of data is required.\n- A specific weakness in the OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 allows for a 'special DROWN attack,' which greatly reduces the effort required to break the encryption, allowing for real-time person-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Description\n\nThe attack which involves collecting SSL traffic using legacy block ciphers via a person-in-the-middle context and subjecting it to a collision attack.\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nSWEET32\n\n### Name\n\nSWEET32\n\n### CVE Number\n\nCVE-2016–2183 and CVE-2016–6329\n\n### Type of Vulnerability\n\nThe attack takes advantage of flaws in the design of some block ciphers.\n\n### Affected\n\nCarrying out the TLS variant of the Sweet32 attack successfully requires a very specific set of capabilities on the part of the attacker:\n\n- The attacker must be able to run JavaScript in the victim's browser to generate data for transmission to the server.\n- The attacker must keep the victim on the malicious JavaScript page for one to two days to generate enough ciphertext blocks to find a collision.\n\n### Remediation\n\nDo not support or negotiate 3DES cipher-suites. At a minimum, AES should be preferred over 3DES.

It allows an attacker to decrypt modern TLS connections between up-to-date clients and servers by sending probes to any server that supports SSLv2 and uses the same private key.\n- At the time of publication (August 2016), the team behind the paper \"DROWN: Breaking TLS Using SSLv2\" was able to attack and decrypt a TLS 1.2 handshake using 2048-bit RSA in under eight hours, at a cost of $440 on Amazon EC2.\n\n## Quick Reference \n\n### Description\n\nDecrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN) is an attack that demonstrates that even if you do not allow SSLv2, simply supporting it can be dangerous. It allows an attacker to decrypt TLS connections between clients and servers.\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nDROWN\n\n### Name\n\nDecrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption\n\n### CVE Number\n\nCVE-2016-0800\n\n### Type of Vulnerability\n\nWithin the SSL v2.0 protocol when paired with export grade ciphers. \n\n### Affected\n\nTwo types of systems are vulnerable. \n\n1. A system supporting SSLv2. (Systems that support SSLv2 negotiation are still surprisingly common!)\n2. A system that uses its private key on any other server that allows SSLv2 connections, even if it is for a different protocol. TLS, for example, is another protocol. The original system is vulnerable as long as SSLv2 can be negotiated on the second system.\n\n### Remediation\n\nRemove support for SSL v2, and best practises would suggest removing anything older than TLS 1.1. TLS 1.0 does not need to be supported. \n\nEven if you are confident that you have disabled SSLv2 on your HTTPS server, you could be reusing your private key on another server (such as an email server) that does support SSLv2. We recommend manually inspecting all servers that use your private key."},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/vulnerabilities-in-ssl-and-tls-heartbleed"},"excerpt":"Main Points Does not require a person-in-the-middle position to work -- unlike many other attacks in our \"Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS…","frontmatter":{"date":"6th January 2022 ","title":"Vulnerabilities in SSL & TLS :- Heartbleed","description":"In this article, we look at CVE Number CVE-2014-0160 or what is commonly referred to as the Heartbleed vulnerability; a buffer overflow in the Heartbeat extension of OpenSSL. A malicious client could send a specially crafted packet to disclose a limited portion of the server or computer's memory per request from a connected client or server. The disclosed portions of memory could include sensitive information, such as private keys, names, usernames, passwords and/or any other data on the system.","tags":"heartbleed, openssl, ssl, tls","posttype":"article"},"body":"## Main Points\n\n- **Does not** require a person-in-the-middle position to work -- unlike many other attacks in our \"Vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS\" series.\n- Found in OpenSSL's implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol -- rather than the protocol itself or one of its components.\n- OpenSSL 1.0.1 added a \"Heartbeat\" extension in December 2011 whose goal was to avoid the need to re-establish SSL sessions and extend their lifespan. Later, a flaw was introduced into the Hearbeat extension's code.\n- Apache and Nginx power much of the internet's infrastructure and by default use OpenSSL. Some sources claim that at the time of the Heartbleed attack, 17% of the internet was vulnerable.\n- Heartbleed is a programming error. The TLS heartbeat extension lacks a bounds check, causing incorrect input validation. The extension returns memory contents without checking how much is returned.\n- PHD Student Robin Seggelmann, co-author of the Heartbeat extensions RFC, introduced the bug into the code. Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers, reviewed the code. Henson overlooked a flaw in Seggelmann's implementation, which was introduced into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The flaw spread rapidly with the release of OpenSSL 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012, with Heartbeat support enabled by default. 1.0.1g, released on April 7, 2014.\n- Affects either a server or a client using a vulnerable OpenSSL TLS instance.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nNo abbreviation, just referred to as Heartbleed. \n\n### Name\n\nHeartbleed\n\n### CVE Number\n\nCVE-2014-0160\n\n### Where is Vulnerability\n\nThe vulnerability is in the OpenSSL implementation of SSL/TLS and not the SSL/TLS protocol itself.  \n\n### Affected\n\nOnly 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases of OpenSSL are affected including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1.\n\n### Remediation\n\nAs long as the vulnerable version of OpenSSL is in use, it can be abused.
