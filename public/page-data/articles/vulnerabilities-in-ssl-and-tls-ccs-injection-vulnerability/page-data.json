An attacker can do this by tampering with the SSL negotiation process.\n- SSL handshake will try to use the most recently supported version of TLS (starting with say TLS 1.2) at both the client and the server. However, for compatibility reasons, many clients have implemented a fallback mechanism that lets them retry a failed negotiation by using an older version. If an attacker interferes with the SSL negotiation process to disrupt it, the client will then fall back successively to TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, and finally to SSL 3.0.\n- The vulnerability exploits the way the SSL version 3.0 handles padded bytes when used with Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation.\n- Due to SSLv3's under-specification of the contents of the CBC padding bytes, and since SSLv3 did not say what the padding bytes should be, SSL implementations cannot check those padding bytes which opens SSLv3 up to an oracle attack.\n- This may allow a person-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt a selected byte of ciphertext.\n- To decrypt the stream requires as few as 256 SSL version 3 connections; however, they would need to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over a newly created SSL version 3.0 connection. This would require social engineering.\n- To exploit this as a web vulnerability, the attacker must possess the following:\n    1. The attacker must control the connection between the client and the server.\n    2. The attacker must be able to inject code into the victim's browser (e.g. JavaScript code) to launch the attack successfully.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Description\n\nVia a person-in-the-middle position, the victim is forced to downgrade to SSL v3.0, which contains an oracle attack. Whether a server or a client - and you do not wish to fall short of this vulnerability - then disable support for SSL completely as per the remediation section. \n\n### Abbreviation\n\nPOODLE\n\n### Name\n\nPadding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy\n\n### CVE Number\n\nCVE-2014-3566\n\n### Type of Vulnerability\n\nA padding-oracle attack - The SSL protocol 3.0 uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier for person-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack.\n\n### Affected\n\nThis vulnerability affects all SSL version 3.0 compliant products.\n\n### Remediation\n\nDo not Support SSL version 3 or lower.\n\nPlease note that this will break the website connection for IE6 users, should this browser be important for some reason. \n\n```bash\nFor Apache: SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3\nFor Nginx: ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n```\n\n## How to Configure Web Server to Mitigate POODLE Vulnerability\n\nTo protect our web server against [POODLE](https://evilsaint.com/article/vulnerabilities-ssl-tls-poodle/), it is recommended to stop support for SSL version 3.0 or lower. This, however, would still leave us vulnerable to [BEAST](https://evilsaint.com/article/vulnerabilities-ssl-tls-beast/), where it is recommended to stop support for TLS 1.0 as well. \n\n### Apache Web Server\n\nEdit the SSLProtocol directive in the ssl.conf file, which is usually located in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf. For example, if you have:\n```\nSSLProtocol all\n```\n\nchange it to:\n```\nSSLProtocol TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2\n```\nThen, restart httpd.\n\n### NGINX\n\nEdit the ssl_protocols directive in the nginx.conf file. For example, if you have:\n```\nssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n```\n\nchange it to:\n```\nssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n```\n\nThen, restart nginx.\n\n### Microsoft IIS\n\nTo disable TLS 1.0 in Microsoft IIS, you must edit the registry settings in Microsoft Windows.\n\n1. Open the registry editor\n\t* Find the key `HKLM SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.0\\Server`\n\t* Change the DWORD value of the Enabled entry to `0`.\n\t* Create a `DisabledByDefault` entry and change the DWORD value to `1`.\n\n2.
