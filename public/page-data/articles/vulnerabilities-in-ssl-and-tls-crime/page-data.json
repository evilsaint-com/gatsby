The attacker requires a person-in-the-middle position, the ability to control plaintext on a website visited by the victim, and the ability to intercept encrypted messages.\n\n### Remediation\n\nDisable SSL/TLS compression to prevent the CRIME attack. CRIME can be defeated by preventing the use of compression, either at the client end, by disabling compression of SPDY requests in the browser, or by the website preventing the use of data compression on such transactions using the TLS protocol negotiation features."},"prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/vulnerabilities-in-ssl-and-tls-beast"},"excerpt":"Main Points The attacker must use a different exploit to become a person-in-the-middle and to inject content into the network traffic…","frontmatter":{"date":"14th January 2022 ","title":"Vulnerabilities in SSL & TLS :- BEAST","description":"In this article, we will look at CVE Number CVE-2011-3389, also known as BEAST.

This is called a protocol downgrade attack. Then, the attacker can use the BEAST attack to eavesdrop.\n- The attack leverages weaknesses in cipher block chaining (CBC) to exploit the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol\n- If the attacker can get into a person-in-the-middle position while the victims are using TLS 1.0, they may silently decrypt secrets.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n### Description\n\nA vulnerability that allows a person-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a connection and downgrade encryption support to (vulnerable) TLS 1.0. This allows attackers to decrypt the traffic and listen in on conversations.\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nBEAST\n\n### Name\n\nBrowser Exploit Against SSL/TLS\n\n### CVE Number\n\nCVE-2011-3389\n\n### Type of Vulnerability\n\nIn the SSL protocol and TLS 1.0\n\n### Affected\n\nIf you support TLS 1.0 or any version of SSL, then you are vulnerable to BEAST. \n\nOriginally, the RC4 cipher was recommended for use to mitigate BEAST attacks (because it is a stream cipher, not a block cipher). However, RC4 was later found to be unsafe.\n\n## How to Configure Web Server to Mitigate BEAST Vulnerability\n\nTo protect our web server against [POODLE](https://evilsaint.com/article/vulnerabilities-ssl-tls-poodle/) it is recommended to stop support for SSL version 3.0 or lower. This, however, would still leave us vulnerable to [BEAST](https://evilsaint.com/article/vulnerabilities-ssl-tls-beast/), where it is recommended to stop support for TLS 1.0 as well. \n\n### Apache Web Server\n\nEdit the SSLProtocol directive in the ssl.conf file, which is usually located in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf. For example, if you have:\n```\nSSLProtocol all\n```\n\nchange it to:\n```\nSSLProtocol TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2\n```\nThen, restart httpd.\n\n### NGINX\n\nEdit the ssl_protocols directive in the nginx.conf file. For example, if you have:\n```\nssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n```\n\nchange it to:\n```\nssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n```\n\nThen, restart nginx.\n\n### Microsoft IIS\n\nTo disable TLS 1.0 in Microsoft IIS, you must edit the registry settings in Microsoft Windows.\n\n1. Open the registry editor\n\t* Find the key `HKLM SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\SCHANNEL\\Protocols\\TLS 1.0\\Server`\n\t* Change the DWORD value of the Enabled entry to `0`.\n\t* Create a `DisabledByDefault` entry and change the DWORD value to `1`.\n\n2. Repeat the above steps for all versions of SSL."},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/vulnerabilities-in-ssl-and-tls-logjam"},"excerpt":"Main Points For this attack to work, the attacker must use a different exploit to become a person-in-the-middle and inject content into the…","frontmatter":{"date":"10th January 2022 ","title":"Vulnerabilities in SSL & TLS :- Logjam","description":"In this article we will look at the SSL Logjam vulnerability.
