We follow this with a `.` and then the name of the  SSH folder (note lowercase). \n\n> The SSH folder starts with a `.` as it  is a hidden folder.\n\nLooking at the screenshot we can see by just accepting defaults and pressing through the `ssh-keygen` command we have a public and private key in their default place (the users directory) and they have the appropriate permissions set. \n\nNow for the next part of this article we are going to want the exact same key pair on the `demo2` machine. \n\nFirst though let us see one more use of the `ssh-keygen` command. Remember that SHA1 fingerprint from earlier. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/999b1e82-eb1a-4107-9056-4a7add0c7326.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo buy running `ssh-keygen -l -v -f` and pointing it as either the public or private key we can confirm that the fingerprint show matches the one generated. \n\n> MD5 is not recommended these days due to potential collisions however if you need to test fingerprints as MD5 you can use the following\n\n```\n&num; get the MD5 for private key\nopenssl pkey -in /path/to/privatekey -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c\n\n&num; get the MD5 for public key\nopenssl pkey -in /path/to/publickey -pubin -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -\n```\n\n## Copying Keys To Another Server\n\nFirst I want to clarify some common mistakes. I know of other consultants who have thought they could use the following command to add the keys to another server. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/f16d3f8a-372b-49b3-8476-7ffd8458346f.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nOkay there is a  lot happening in this picture and I want to break some of it down. \n\nFirstly I have changed directory to the root of the server `cd /` to show you do not need to be in the same folder as the keys to use this command. Secondly we can see the servers current fingerprint just like we did with the first server. Notice the server fingerprint is not the same and any fingerprints we have generated or seen so far. If we look further down we can see that the first time I had to manually authenticate to the sever and then we can see that the number of key(s) copied were \"Number of key(s) added: 1\". \n\nLet us have a look what is going on.  \n\n> Please note I have already SSH to the box so no fingerprint for me to accept in this screenshot. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/a2d5285c-008f-4c1e-83a0-adc00aead2d3.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNow let us examine the `.ssh` folder\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/6ead762c-7d59-4ac3-a5b3-25d423962665.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n* not keys have been copied across as the name in the command might suggest. \n* the public key on demo1 has been added into the `authorized_keys` on demo2 but the `id_rsa` private key and `id_rsa.pub` key were not transferred.\n* Once an SSH key has been created, the ssh-copy-id command can be used to install it as an authorized key on the server. Once the key has been authorized for SSH, it grants access to the server without a password. That's its function. \n\n\nSo know we have seen that the function of `ssh-copy-id` and how it does it job there should be little reason to worry about placing keys and authorized file entries into golden build images. You spin the server and then the admin (demo1) in this situation uses the  `ssh-copy-id`. \n\n## Let us look at an alternative, up comes box 3.\n\nThe admin has a new machine deployed on his network. For the sake of simplicity, we have called it \"demo3\". \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/a18fe094-7160-40da-9e2c-993576244135.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWith server 3 booted the admin on host \"demo1\" wants to be able to SSH into demo3. We know that the admins public key hosted on demo one needs to be placed inside the authorized keys of demo3.\n\nJust for excitement as so you keep learning something new as you read. Let us not use the `ssh-copy-id` command. \n```\ncat id_rsa.pub | ssh root@95.179.138.81 'cat > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@95.179.138.81 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'\n```\n\nTwo things should be noted. This time we do need to be in the directory of the SSH Public key folder or we need to put in an explicit path as in example two.  The aim here is to to `cat` the public key and pipe it to the authorized keys. \n\nWe have two problems, however! 1) We don't even know if this file exists yet which will result in an error. Secondly, it may be exist and have keys already in it that we don't want to overwrite with a single \">\" symbol.\n\nIf we just want SSH to run a command and return we can list it as the end of the ssh command. \n\n```\nssh root@95.179.138.81 'ls -Rl ~/'\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/a8a4d6bd-3365-468d-b8d0-1178fd662187.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nAs we can see, the root folder is pretty empty and so out command would result in error unless we made a directory first. Now we have started this was we will continue but I just wanted to highligh some of the extra steps the `ssh-copy-id` command takes care of such as create the folders, files and getting the permissions right. However lets proceed.\n\nLets make the folder using the `-p` that creates any directories needed along the way. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/2d66bf01-f47e-4ac8-9552-67f513418529.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNow lets copy the public key across. \n\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/be001666-6d2a-43bf-b561-046d20dc6e66.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo with the public key copied across, albeit a lot more work we should be in a position to SSH into that server without a password.  It should be noted at this point we have a reasonably secure configuration with \"demo1\" being able to access \"demo2\" and \"demo3\". \n\nIt should be noted that \"demo3\" could still connect back to \"demo1\" with a password. Not this might be behavior that is needed but if \"demo1\" is a jump box to other machines in the network we may want to harden \"demo1\" by adjust the config. \n\nPassword authentication defaults to \"yes\", don't want to lock yourself out of a box by accident now do we. Note, even though the field is not set and commented out it shows us the default behavior. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/9c72444d-3604-49fd-ab40-f57556edcce4.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNow before I change around with config and potentially lock myself out of my admin jump box \"demo1\" I need to remember two things. Firstly I need the private key to log in. This can be grabbed from the local system by using the `scp` command. \n```\nscp root@demo1:/root/.ssh/*\n```\n\nI will get asked for my password but I will have my precious keys. However I STILL wont be able to login. The more observant of you by this point should be screaming your authorized_key file is missing. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/9fe2c9c7-8921-47df-8464-4278e5a89ecc.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWe can run the `ssh-copy-id` on localhost but notice we still need to log in. \n\nWith that complete, we can edit the ssh configuration to stop password login from other boxes. This helps secure our jump box. \n\n```\nnano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/05b0645f-745f-4bd9-8cd8-742a7c0ad99d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nLet us uncomment that line and change it to no. Now Demo2 and Demo3 could not ssh to us without a private key and even if they brute forced the correct password for the root user it would not let them connect. \n\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/943e88e6-819d-4652-917b-76f171792883.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nLets restart the service and try it out.  \n```\nsystemctl restart sshd\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/2f040ccb-60c0-4cf6-8790-af306cac9a7b.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNo prompt for a password and a message saying permission denied, something we have all seen on pentests. \n\n\n## What is the known host\n\nWhen we press \"yes\" to accept the fingerprints of servers that we login to their corresponding entries get added to `known_hosts`. If a server fingerprint changes for any one of a number of reasons and it no longer matches what is in the known host we get a warning next time we try and connect to that server. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/fcfbb795-e111-4cb9-b473-2f2bb019eee4.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nLets force one now \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/4d5566f9-622a-4f29-b196-829a93e9cc3e.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nso despite connecting to that machine multiple times before we know have to once again accept the warning..... \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/d00b4621-de90-4a96-b46f-a37ba02fb13c.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nWhen administering a lot of servers from your jump box, pressing yes all the time could end up being quite annoying. Is there another way?\n\n# Enter `sshkey-scan`\n\nSo lets have a look at this useful tool. I will admit in out three machine setup it is overkill but it does let us look at the options a bit easier. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/243b3a86-cedc-48cc-ab8a-69a4423f7f1d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nSo what is going on here! First, we can see the format of the original known_host file (the one I modified with 'l33t'). \n\nI have then emptied out the known host file due to the fact we are about to fill it. Please note that the known_host file hasnt been filled yet as we still have to redirect out command back into the the file. Before we get that far lets have a look when we don't give `ssh-keyscan` a format for the known host file. Each IP I gave it was submitted as ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa, and ed25519. In addition it fingerprints the end server boxes for their IP, ports and their operating system version and leaves it as a comment before each entry. This makes this a rather useful tool. \n\nIf you have more than the few machines that I have here then you can supply them as a file with the `-f` option. \n\n> Note, make sure you include machines you trust and you know haven't been compromised. Regenerating the known hosts will remote the warning telling you if a host has changed since you last approved it so double check. \n\nLets create out known host file and check it out. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/7db3a1b7-9276-4a9e-8463-b824f30514b3.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nso let us run out command and see if we can login with no warning. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/b0417e4f-4dea-4e36-9391-709dbe3c562d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nNow before I finish part one of this article; I do appreciate you staying with me while we go through the some of the configuration of the process. I just want to show you one more thing for the lazy admin... like me!\n\n## Config\n\nThe local SSH Config can allow us to do some very complex things. We will only cover some of the really useful features here\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/bd5c27cf-637c-41d5-b31c-09f91b7537be.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nMy \"config\" file for my jumpbox on demo1\n\n```\nHost demo2\n        HostName 78.141.216.246\n        User root\n\nHost demo3\n        HostName 95.179.138.81\n        User root\n```\n\nNow with just `ssh demo2` it replaces `ssh root@78.141.216.246`\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/de62bb13-f3c3-4dcb-ab34-8a5935e1c437.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this first article, we looked at some of the SSH commands responsible for deployed Private Key Infrastructure with SSH. We look at a reasonable good practice with regards to making a jump box and got a general understanding of the difference between the config file, the known_hosts file, the authorized_keys and the public and private key. \n\nIn the second part of this article, we will expand on part one and go deeper into some of the configuration options and how they are often misconfigured to allow lateral movement, and complete network pwnage. I would however feel I miss-sold you on the title of the article if I didn't show you one basic privilege escalation trick. \n\nIn the screenshot below the admin has backup his private key to a folder with the wrong permissions. Debbie has come along and found this key and has SSH into the host she is on.  Debbie is now the `root` user and has a stable shell.\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/8085e373-485d-4bb1-92b9-af14ef43901d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThis trick was a little contrived but comes up frequently in capture the flag events. \n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n  <img src=\"/static/7fe3301b-18a6-425a-9f7d-6a66770607df.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal text-dark\">System Preferences.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nTry and wrap your head around the basics we talked about today. Next article we will look at SSH Server configuration in detail and the things that often go wrong, we will look at piping tools through SSH, creating tunnels, moving laterally and will talk a lot more about SSH fingerprinting and how it can help us increase the attack surface."},"prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/penetrate-report-repeat"},"excerpt":"","frontmatter":{"date":"28th April 2021 ","title":"Penetrate.
